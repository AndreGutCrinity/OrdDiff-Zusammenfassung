Formally, an ordinary differential equation is an equation, in which a function and its derivates and the independent variable appear.\\

An (implicit) \emph{ordinary differential equation} of order $n$ is an equation of the form
\begin{equation}
  F(x, y, y', y'', ..., y^{(n)}) = 0.
\end{equation}
An example of an explicit ODE of order $n$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
  y^{n} = G(x, y, y', y'', ..., y^{n-1}).
\end{equation}

Remark: The solution of an ODE is not a number, but rather a function, or more precisely: a set of functions.\\
The set of all solutions of an ordinary differential equation is the \emph{general solution} of an ODE. The solution of an initial value problem is a \emph{special} or \emph{particular solution} of the ODE.
